# Improving Priya's Conversational Abilities

This document outlines the steps taken to enhance the conversational abilities of the AI persona "Priya".

## 1. Diagnosis

Initial analysis revealed two main weaknesses:

*   **Simplistic Context:** The system was only using the last 10 messages as context, leading to a very short-term memory. This was identified in `src/user/user.service.ts`.
*   **Hardcoded & Limited Training Data:** Priya's training data was hardcoded within `src/ai-personas/training-data.service.ts` and was not extensive enough to cover a wide range of conversational scenarios.

## 2. Enhancement Strategy

The strategy to improve Priya involved three main pillars:

1.  **Externalize Training Data:** Move the training data to a dedicated, easily manageable file.
2.  **Implement Conversational Summaries:** Instead of just using the last few messages, we will summarize the recent conversation to provide a much richer context to the LLM.
3.  **Refine System Prompt:** Continuously refine the system prompt to better guide the AI's behavior.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Externalizing Training Data

*   **Created `src/ai-personas/training-data/priya.json`:** A new JSON file was created to store a more comprehensive and categorized set of training examples for Priya. This was based on the provided chat logs (`_chat 3.txt` and `_chat 4.txt`).
*   **Refactored `TrainingDataService`:** The `TrainingDataService` in `src/ai-personas/training-data.service.ts` was modified to load and use the training data from the new `priya.json` file. This makes the training data more scalable and easier to update.

### 3.2. Improving Context with Summarization

*   **Increased History Limit:** The number of messages retrieved for conversation history was increased from 10 to 50 in `src/user/user.service.ts`.
*   **Created `SummarizationService`:** A new service was created at `src/summarization/summarization.service.ts`. This service is responsible for taking a conversation history and generating a concise summary using the `LlmService`.
*   **Integrated Summarization into `AiPersonasService`:**
    *   The `SummarizationService` is now used within `AiPersonasService`.
    *   Before generating a response, if the conversation history is sufficiently long, a summary is generated.
    *   This summary is then passed into the system prompt as `Conversation Summary`, giving the LLM a much better understanding of the long-term context of the conversation.
*   **Refactored `WhatsappService`:** The `WhatsappService` was refactored to use the `getEnhancedResponse` method from the `AiPersonasService`, ensuring that all the new enhancements (like summarization) are applied to incoming WhatsApp messages. This centralized the core AI logic in one place.

### 3.3. Improving Conversational Naturalness

*   **Problem:** Initial testing showed that Priya was overusing pet names ("love", "cutie", "baby"), making the conversation feel unnatural and repetitive.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Refined System Prompt:** Priya's system prompt in `src/ai-personas/config/personas.json` was updated. Instead of a blanket instruction to use pet names, it now advises her to use them "occasionally" and to "make it feel natural, not repetitive."
    *   **Refined Training Data:** The training data in `src/ai-personas/training-data/priya.json` was reviewed and edited to remove the excessive use of pet names, aligning the examples with the new, more natural conversational style.

### 3.4. Enhancing Conversational Flow and Proactivity

*   **Problem:** The conversation flow felt unnatural and reactive. Priya would only respond to the user's immediate message without taking initiative.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Proactive Memory:** The system prompt in `src/ai-personas/config/personas.json` was enhanced to instruct Priya to proactively bring up topics from the conversation summary. This allows her to "remember" past details and ask relevant follow-up questions, making the conversation more dynamic.
    *   **Acknowledgement and Validation:** The prompt now also guides Priya to acknowledge and validate the user's feelings before responding, leading to more empathetic and connected replies.
    *   **Gender-Consistent Training:** The training data in `src/ai-personas/training-data/priya.json` was further refined to ensure responses are consistently from the perspective of a girl talking to a guy, making compliments and playful teasing more specific and natural.

### 3.5. Overhauling Coherence and Nuance

*   **Problem:** Conversations still felt incoherent at times, with the AI misinterpreting slang and nuance, as seen in the "spice" example. The flow wasn't fully human-like.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** The system prompt in `src/ai-personas/config/personas.json` was significantly upgraded. It now includes explicit instructions to understand conversational nuance, avoid literal interpretations of slang, and make the Hinglish more fluid and natural, directly referencing the lessons from the "spice" misunderstanding.
    *   **Nuanced Training Examples:** The training data in `src/ai-personas/training-data/priya.json` was overhauled with new examples derived from the provided chat logs. These examples teach the AI how to handle vague replies (like "okays only") appropriately, engage in more complex banter, and maintain a more coherent conversational thread, mirroring the natural flow of human conversation.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the new implementation to see how it performs in real conversations.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Based on test results, continue to refine Priya's system prompt and the prompt used for summarization to achieve the desired conversational style.
*   **User-Specific Summaries:** In the future, we could store and retrieve summaries on a per-user basis to build up a long-term memory of relationship history.
